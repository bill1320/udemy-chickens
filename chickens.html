    <p>
      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a>
      species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
      junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
      is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

    <p>
      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries
      BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
      (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>

    <p>
      According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird)
      originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the
      sexual connotation of the original English cock,[24][25][26] and is widely
      used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to
      sleep at night.

    <h3>Behavior</h3>

    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>

    <p>
      Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
      communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
      Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
      'pecking order', with dominant individuals having priority for food access
      and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a
      temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
      established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock
      can lead to fighting and injury.
    </p>

    <h4>Broodiness</h4>

    <p>
      Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete,
      and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to "go
      broody". The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the
      incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will
      sit or 'set' on the nest, fluffing up or pecking in defense if disturbed
      or removed. The hen will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or
      dust-bathe.[42] While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant
      temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the
      first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place
      several artificial eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the
      hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.
